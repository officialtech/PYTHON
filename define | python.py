An Informal Introduction to Python




Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 
Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, 
make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.




The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). 
Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.



>>>      # this sign is called prompt in pyhton
#        # this sign represent comment in python

you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter.


Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. 
A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. 
A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. 
Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.


# this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
